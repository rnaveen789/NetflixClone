## Objectives
- To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix website (https://www.netflix.com/in/) to inform the development of a clone.
- To document all features, UI/UX design elements, and technical architecture of the Netflix website.

## Research Breakdown

- **UI/UX Design Analysis**: Analyze the visual design, including layout, color palette, typography, and component design.
- **Technical Structure Analysis**: Investigate the website's architecture, page structure, and navigation patterns.

5. How does the user interface change on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)?

## Resource Strategy

## Verification Plan
